# Metaphor-Retranslated
Retranslating the English script for Metaphor: Refantazio


What Is This?

A retranslation of the english script, using machine translation (DeepL, etc.) to make it very 1:1 with the japanese script.

Why?

Because I think the excuse of 'localization' takes far too many creative liberties, causing a vastly different experience for western audiences. 

Disclaimer:
This is a huge game with a lot of text. This will take some time to get through, so don't expect 100% any time soon.
